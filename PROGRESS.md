# MentorOS — Build Progress Log

> Your working memory across sessions. Read this first on any fresh session, then read `plan.md`.
> Update this at every phase gate and before ~60% context usage. **Never** move volatile state back into `plan.md`.

## Current status
- **USER DIRECTIVE (2026-07-06, overrides check-in gates):** auto-continue WITHOUT stopping for approval — finish Phase 5 (all 4 interview types, still built one at a time), then Phase 6, and only stop after Phase 6 is done or the session limit is hit. Keep hard checkpoints (commit + PROGRESS.md) at every slice so a limit cutoff loses nothing. Still run verifier + design-reviewer per slice.
- **Phase:** 5 IN PROGRESS (user approved past Phase-4 gate) — slice 1 = **Coding interview** (one type per check-in per plan.md §Phase 5). Spec = plan.md §4.5 + interview-prep CLAUDE.md protocol (Frame→Interrogate→Scorecard, hint ladder, §5 spaced-rep grades, scorecard→Memory).
- **Contract LANDED in coreClient.ts:** InterviewType/Language/Phase, InterviewProblem(Meta), InterviewSession(Summary), InterviewTurn, EvalResult(+EvalTestResult), InterviewScorecard(+ScorecardDimension); events `interview.token/status/phase/scorecard`; methods listInterviewProblems/listInterviewSessions/startInterview/getInterviewSession/interviewSend/requestHint/runInterviewTests/finishCoding/endInterview/abandonInterview → routes under `/interview/*`.
- **Next step (exact):** (1) **core-engineer**: `src/core/interview/*` — problem bank (~10 originals-worded LC classics across his 3mc patterns, python+javascript starter+tests), SQLite tables (interview_sessions/turns/attempts/scorecards), eval runner (spawn python3/node harness, JSON protocol, 2s/test timeout), phase-scoped interviewer prompts (llama3.1, zero-praise staff-engineer voice per interview-prep CLAUDE.md §0), hint ladder (3 rungs, logged), endInterview → LLM-JSON scorecard → persist + write memories via existing memory service (skill: pattern confidence; mistake entries) → emit `interview.scorecard`; routes; weakness-targeted recommendation from mistake-type memories. (2) **builder**: launcher (4 gradient-glyph cards, only Coding enabled) + session screen (problem md left / Monaco right — `monaco-editor` npm + vite `?worker` bundling, NO CDN; transcript+mini FallbackOrb bottom-left; Run/Hint/Finish toolbar; results drawer; scorecard overlay w/ memoryWrites chips) + interviewStore + Rail/⌘K wiring. (3) Me: integrate/polish, verifier, design-reviewer, fix, commit, CHECK-IN.
- **Design-review fixes (all committed):** markdown reading renderer (`ReadingMarkdown.tsx` — headings/GFM tables/lists/blockquotes; relative links switch files in folder sources; external links → system browser via new main-process setWindowOpenHandler); container-query KB grid + header reflow (900px OK); citation reconciliation in chat.ts (pills list only sources the answer actually cites [n], full-list fallback if model cites none — verified live, filtered 5→1); Add-source popover anchored + real --focus rings; **honest search** — FTS strict-AND w/ OR fallback only ≤2-term queries + vector floor 0.6 (measured nomic cosines: junk tops ~0.57, real semantic 0.72+; "zzzz"/"pizza toppings" → 0 hits → designed empty state (screenshot verified), keyword+NL queries still strong). 50 tests green.
- **Built (this commit):** KB contract in `coreClient.ts` (+ `ChatMessage.citations`); preload `getPathForFile` bridge + `renderer/lib/nativeBridge.ts` (Electron 43 removed File.path); core `src/core/kb/*` — store (kb_sources/kb_chunks/FTS5 `kb_chunks_fts`/kb_chunk_vectors, sanitized FTS queries), chunker (~800/150, md headings→section, pdf pages→`p. N`), ingest (md/txt/pdf via pdf-parse, folder walk, idempotent chunk ids, FTS-only degrade when Ollama down, home-dir path guard), search (RRF k=60, matched flags, snippets), suggestions (DSA patterns + SD concepts), routes incl. POST /kb/sources/:id/open; chat.ts grounding (gate: top hit fts/both, or vector cosine ≥0.45; max 5 excerpts ≤700ch; emits chat.sources; persists citations_json); renderer KB screen `screens/knowledge/*` + `lib/kbStore.ts` (grid/suggestions/drag-drop+progress toasts/search view/reading view/all states); chat citation pills ([n] superscripts, source-pill row) + live ContextPanel "Sources cited". 50 tests green, both tsc green, electron-vite build green.
- **Phase 4 verified (runtime, 10/11):** suggestions offered; patterns folder 9 files/83 chunks + real PDF 24 chunks ingested w/ kb.ingest events; hybrid search 8 hits w/ matched flags; grounded chat → chat.sources 5 citations, [n] in answer, persisted across restart; Ollama-down → FTS-only search AND ingest still work, recovers to vector after `open -a Ollama`; re-ingest idempotent (same sourceId, 83→83); reveal route 204/404. Citation pills deep-link into the source's reading view. FIXED: LibraryGrid zustand selector returned fresh array → infinite render loop → blank screen (filter moved outside selector).
- **Wi-Fi-off check = needs the user live** (an agent cutting Wi-Fi kills its own API link; all traffic is localhost so Ollama-down is the real degradation test — passed).
- **Next step (exact):** (1) collect **design-reviewer** result (KB library/search/reading + grounded chat, dark+light, screenshots → scratchpad `/p4/`); fix any drift it reports (files: screens/knowledge/*, chat/AssistantMessage.tsx, shell/ContextPanel.tsx). (2) Commit fixes. (3) **Hard check-in**: Phase 4 delivered summary w/ screenshots; offer Phase 5 = Coding interview first (one type per window per plan.md).
- **Phase 2+3 verified:** upsert-by-similarity = cosine gate + lexical guard + **llama3.1 merge-judge** (paraphrases merge, distinct facts keep, judge fails open to create; ~2s judged saves); interview-prep import 30 records idempotent (0/30 on re-run); recall injected into chat/voice with chat.context trust events; 3mc import 147 days/785 tasks idempotent with week focus topics; mission = 2-3 plan tasks + due review + weakness drill (top-up if plan imported mid-day); streak/XP/heat persist across restart (verified); linkPass gives graph edges; 42 unit tests green.
- **Known gaps (deliberate):** graph edges sparse (2 on current data — linking is title-in-body only); voice auto-capture keywords are heuristic; review-queue records that collapsed pre-judge in the old DB stay merged; day rows show generic titles (topic lives on the week label).
- **Screenshots:** scratchpad `/2a/` (memory profile/graph/drawer) and `/p23/` (home mission + fill, learning path, graph with edges).

## User's real-data sources (reviewed 2026-07-05 — import these, they replace synthetic seed)
- **`~/Documents/abhay/3-month-challenge/`** — 147 `day-*.md` (21 weeks: DSA + infra skill per day) with a WORKING parser → `study-ui/data/parsed-plan.json` (stable task IDs `phase-n-week-w-day-d-lc-num`, typed tasks, difficulty). No persisted progress (only localStorage in their study-ui) → MentorOS Learning Engine becomes the real tracker. User says daily volume is too heavy — mission selection should right-size.
- **`~/Documents/abhay/interview-prep/`** — 86 md, ~1 week of data, but PRESCRIPTIVE schemas: `recurring-mistakes.md` (mistake tally: Complexity miscalc ×8, Missed optimization ×4…), `review-queue.md` (spaced-rep grades 0-5 + ISO next-review dates), `patterns-learned.md` (confidence 1-5), per-problem interrogation scorecards, journal. Maps ~1:1 to memory types (mistake/skill/learning). `DSA/patterns/` (9 playbooks) + `System Design/concepts/` → Phase 4 KB import. Its CLAUDE.md interview protocol (Frame→Interrogate→Scorecard) is the spec to reuse for Phase 5.

## Improvement backlog (user feedback at Phase-1 gate — schedule in Phase 7 unless pulled earlier)
- STT accuracy "a bit sloppy" → offer whisper `medium.en` / `large-v3-turbo` as a quality option (small.en stays default for latency).
- Only one TTS voice → voice picker (Kokoro ships ~54 voices; cheap win, Settings).
- Avatar/"face" for the mentor (big; design exploration later — Orb stays the primary identity).
- **Model switching incl. cloud** (Claude Opus / Fable via the §2.4 router, opt-in + budget) — Phase 7 cloud adapters; look up current model IDs/pricing then.
- Interim (live) transcripts while speaking; hands-free VAD barge-in; wake word (onboarding phase).
- **1b verified:** streaming ladder over WS; stop→partial persistence; Ollama-offline designed banner + error event; SQLite at userData/data. Screenshots `/1b/`.
- **1c verified:** whisper small.en arm64+Metal (~514ms warm) + Kokoro af_heart (~560ms TTFC) sidecars, /voice WS matches contract exactly; UI: real TTS → orb speaking → idle on tts-end; interrupt ducks; 4 orb states visually distinct; reduced-motion FallbackOrb OK. Screenshots `/1c/`.
- **Needs the user live (first run):** macOS mic permission prompt → real hold-Space voice loop; network-off repeat; ⌥Space may need Accessibility permission; first whisper call pays one-time ~7s Metal shader compile.
- **Known 1c gaps (deliberate):** no interim transcripts (final on release only); barge-in is PTT/tap-triggered, hands-free VAD later; wake word deferred to onboarding phase.
- **Approved Phase-1 execution plan:** `~/.claude/plans/read-plan-md-and-eager-blossom.md`.

## Decisions log
- Node via nvm v22.16.0 (`.nvmrc`), pnpm via corepack. Machine default node is v12 — always `export PATH="$HOME/.nvm/versions/node/v22.16.0/bin:$PATH"`.
- Stack pins: electron 43, electron-vite 5, vite 7 (peer range), react 18.3, tailwind v4 (`@theme inline` maps Nocturne vars), fastify 5 + @fastify/websocket, motion, zustand, lucide, fontsource variable fonts (bundled).
- Core server runs in-process in Electron main (core has zero electron imports); port 4820 scan-up; renderer discovers via `?corePort=` query param.
- Added @fastify/cors (localhost origins + `null` for packaged file://) — renderer health fetch was CORS-blocked in dev (verifier caught it).
- Default local model: `llama3.1:8b` (installed; clean streaming — qwen3 emits <think> blocks).
- Design-review nits deferred: context panel should auto-collapse under ~900px width; light-theme `--faint` contrast re-check when real screens land.
- CDP screenshot recipe: `pnpm --filter @mentoros/desktop dev -- --remote-debugging-port=9222` (single `--`), drive via ws + Page.captureScreenshot. 1a screenshots in scratchpad `/1a/`.

- 1c research (done): STT = whisper.cpp (`brew install whisper-cpp` or source w/ GGML_METAL), model `ggml-small.en.bin` (466 MiB, HF ggerganov/whisper.cpp); no native WS streaming — use whisper-stream/server or wrap. TTS = **Kokoro instead of Piper** (Piper repo archived Oct 2025, python-only fork, seconds-level latency; Kokoro ~100ms TTFA on M4 Pro via kokoro/kokoro-mlx, 24kHz PCM streaming). Piper fallback: OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl + en_US-lessac-medium.
- Voice-loop state machine + CSS FallbackOrb already written (`renderer/orb/orbState.ts`, `FallbackOrb.tsx`) — shader Orb + audio plumbing still pending in 1c.

- better-sqlite3 must be built for **arm64** (nvm node is x86_64/Rosetta but Electron is arm64): postinstall pinned to `electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3 --arch arm64`.
- 1b core-engineer run was killed by a session limit mid-task; Fable finished the last wiring (dataDir passthrough, arm64 rebuild) per the escalate-once rule.
- `pkill -f ollama` is case-insensitive-trap: menubar app is `Ollama` (capital) and respawns `ollama serve`; use `pkill -9 -f -i ollama` in tests, restore with `open -a Ollama`.
